<h1>About Me</h1>


<p> 
My name is Viktoriia Stremple, and I have always been inspired by complex challenges. This passion for growth led me to programmingâ€”a world where I can create, solve interesting problems, and bring ideas to life.</p>Previously, I worked in photography and watercolor painting, creating illustrations of characters, flowers, and animals. My works have been published in 14 European magazines, including Selin, Marika, and Vigour. I have experience with Photoshop, sewing, and design.
  
  <p>I also own a photo studio, Light House 2.0, in Pittsburgh, where I offer professional photo sessions.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to my creative pursuits, I am passionate about social initiatives. One of my projects was a charitable event where I taught watercolor painting to people in need, combining art with community support.</p>
  
 <p>Now, I am learning web development to merge creativity with technology and build modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites. This is my new challenge, and I am excited to embrace it.</p>
